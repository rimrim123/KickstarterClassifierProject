# KickstarterClassifierProject

Intro: 
While brainstorming project ideas with our newly formed group, we found that one thing we were all curious about was crowdfunding campaigns on sites such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc. We decided that it would be interesting to look at what makes fundraising campaigns on such sites successful, and if there are certain factors that successful campaigns all exhibit. Thus, our group idea was to look at historical data on various Kickstarter campaigns, and attempt to make sense of what factors influence a campaign being funded or not. We acquired our datasets from Kaggle, an online community of open data sets. We have worked together to conduct preliminary data analysis and even train a machine learning model using Scikit-learn to predict whether or not a Kickstarter campaign will be funded based on various factors. 

In this repo, I have posted the final report which summarizes our findings and our approach to this project.
